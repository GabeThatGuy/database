## The Internet
This article encompasses the internet and how it works.

### General Info
The Internet is a massive network of computers, connected together by massive switching centres called "Internet Exchanges". With various protocols for transmitting and receiving data between computers, the internet is formed.

## Protocols of the Internet

### IP: The Internet Protocol
IP also known as the internet protocol is responsible for organizing all devices connected to the internet. It does so by giving each device an address, typically four numbers separated by dots. This address is unique and it's how a server knows which device on the internet to send information to. IP has 2 main versions, IPv4 and IPv6. IPv4 is the most popular, and supports a maximum of 4,228,250,625 devices. IPv6 was created to address the problem of limited IPv4 adresses. IPv6 can support a maximum of 2.02824096 x 10^31 devices. 

### HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol
HTTP or Hypertext Transfer Protocol is one of the most important protocols that the internet uses. HTTP is the protocol that servers on the internet use to transmit webpages to a client's web browser. An HTTP URL takes the form of: http://URL. You may also see https://URL, which is known as Secure HTTP. 

### HTML: Hypertext Markup Language
HTML is the programming language of the web. Every single website you've ever visited was written in HTML or converted to HTML by some web development software. This website was written in Markdown, which is converted by your web browser into HTML and then rendered as the pixels you're reading right now.

### DNS: Domain Name System
DNS is the protocol that is used by *DNS Servers* to translate a URL, for example google.com, into an IP address. By doing this, users do not have to remember the IP addresses of the websites they want to visit, and do not have to re-memorize such an address every time it changes. They simply have to remember a URL that never changes, and the rest is handled by the DNS server.
